    "Even though all of the tests and visualizations above seem to indicate the data is not approximately normally distributed, the sample size is large enough (>700) that the result's of a welch's t-test are still valid. After several hours of research, I've concluded that as sample size increases, meeting the normality assumption becomes less and less important to an effective t-test. Even if the underlying data is not normally distributed, the **distribution of sample means of that data is a normal distribution**, especially as the size of the sample increases. Since the t-test is a direct comparison of the two sample means, it doesn't matter that the data is skewed because the **distribution of the sample means** will be approximately normal (as long as the sample size is large enough).\n",

    "I reccomend expanding the discount program and dialing down discounts of more than 10%. It seems that the incentive of any discount is enough to drive up quantities, and larger discounts will lead to lesser profits. In particular, Northwind should target customers who are not currently receiving a lot of discounts, and begin offering them minor discounts on all products."

    "Having come to a conclusion on discounts, I'll now begin to examine employee performance. The first question I'm interested in is whether or not USA and UK employees perform differently. To test this, I'll compare the ORDER quantity for orders handled by USA sales reps to ORDER quantity for orders handled by UK sales reps. This will also take some nested SQL statements to get the data I need. Note that the metric we're using the evaluate employee performance is the total quantity of all products on a single order. Because we're considering each employee as a group, this analysis could potentially be biased by extreme outliers within each group. To account for this, I will do an individual employee analysis later."

Ideally, I'd be able to analyze the profitability of each order so that I could evaluate each order on its contribution to the company's overall financial health.\n",
